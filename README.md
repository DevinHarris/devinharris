# Devin Harris

Hi and welcome, here you'll find code of various sorts. I love to experiment with new technologies so a lot of what I share here are "playgrounds" where I experiment with the different features of intriguing tools, languages, frameworks, etc in effort to understand them on a deeper level and to grow my overall skills.... 

There's also my own personal projects too, where I'll be building useful real-world things with these tools.

## Most importantly: Let's build some cool stuff together!
